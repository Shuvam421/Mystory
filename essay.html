        <h1>My School Life</h1>
        <p>
            Myself, <b>Shuvam Mondal</b>, a high school boy now in class IX. I am a student of <i>Rajaram Chowk Shiksha Niketan (H.S)</i> school located in a small town in India named Nandigram in the Purba Medinipur district in West Bengal state.<br><br>
            My school life is not like that of a normal boy as I have faced many problems and depression, but it also gave me some important lessons.<br><br>
            I have a dream to be great and to do something that will make me immortal in people's hearts. I am a person who spends most of his time thinking about scientific phenomena and trying to explain them. Due to my weird ideas and actions, which are not weird at all, people always stay away from me. Since childhood, I have been bullied by others for my looks and my ideas, which they think are stupid. I was a bright student with bright dreams. I am the only hope of my family; they believe in me, they did their best to support me, and they are still doing their best. However, now the brightness has become dull. Everything was fine until the lockdown started, marking the beginning of my downfall. During that period, I was very lonely and became depressed and introverted. After two years of lockdown, when our school finally reopened, I was the happiest student of all. I started my studies with full confidence and motivation. But last year, when my grandma died, I was completely broken, and it was the time of our annual exam. My marks were bad, my friends started avoiding me, and for an unknown reason, she stopped talking to me and also started avoiding me. She does not love me, but I love her more than myself. Unfortunately, we cannot even be friends. Now, I have no confidence, and no motivation works for me. I have become a <span class="highlight">LOSER!</span>
